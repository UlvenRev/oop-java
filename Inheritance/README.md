## Inheritance Assignment

#### Purpose

The following code demostrates the OOP Principle of Inheritance.

Unlike composition, inheritance is a "is a" relationship, i.e. Poker "is a" BoardGame "is a" Game. Basically, you can go like this from bottom to the top with any structure that has an inheritance relationship.

Also demonstrated in the solution:
- Abstract classes and their use
- Overriding methods
- Polymorphism

#### File Structure

As said before:
Game 
  -> VideoGame
    -> SpiderMan
    -> DeadByDaylight
  -> BoardGame
    -> Poker
    -> DnD
